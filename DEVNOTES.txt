This file contains a variety of development notes. I'll keep my FIXMEs and TODOs in here.

We should consider disabling some "unsafe" Lua built in functions such
as dofile(), load() and loadfile(), etc.

It appears that "Sandbox" is the term you're looking for.
See http://lua-users.org/wiki/SandBoxes. Also read the discussion
of the topic at http://stackoverflow.com/q/966162/115589 and

It seems that the accepted solution is to not call luaL_openlibs()
and rather copying and modifying linit.c

My Bitmap module should have a #pragma pack() at the
structure declaration. The PAK file module should have
it too. See the bottom of this section on the wikipedia:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure_alignment#Typical_alignment_of_C_structs_on_x86
(Seems it is not a big GCC issue, rather a MSVC thing)

Speaking of the PAK file module, the ZIP file format turns out to be
not that different, so I should look into it more closely.

The contents of mappings.c can now be moved to bmp.c since the keyboard key-name mapping has been removed.

Descision whether to stick with scancodes or switch keycodes?

Implement fullscreen mode on F11 keypress.

Allow window to be resized.

Docs says SDL_UpdateTexture() be slow. Do something different.
