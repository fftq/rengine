This file contains a variety of development notes. I'll keep my FIXMEs
and TODOs in here.

We should consider disabling some "unsafe" Lua built in functions such
as dofile(), load() and loadfile(), etc.

It appears that "Sandbox" is the term you're looking for.
See http://lua-users.org/wiki/SandBoxes. Also read the discussion
of the topic at http://stackoverflow.com/q/966162/115589 and
http://stackoverflow.com/q/1224708/115589

It seems that the accepted solution is to not call luaL_openlibs()
and rather copying and modifying linit.c

My Bitmap module should have a #pragma pack() at the
structure declaration. The PAK file module should have
it too. See the bottom of this section on the wikipedia:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure_alignment in the section
"Typical alignment of C structs on x86" (Seems it is not a big GCC issue,
rather a MSVC thing)

Speaking of the PAK file module, the ZIP file format turns out to be
not that different, so I should look into it more closely.

The bmp.c can do with an bm_arc(bmp, start_angle, end_angle, radius)
function.

bmp.c is also still missing a bm_fillellipse() function.

Descision whether to stick with scancodes or switch to keycodes? Or make
it configurable?

Docs says SDL_UpdateTexture() be slow. Do something different.

# Editor:

Changing the Working Directory affects the tilesets, so you should rather
set the working directory when you start a new project.

I should rethink the way the class and id is handled.  The specific
problem is that each tile can only have one class and id, regardless of
the number of layers.  I think they should be stored more like the meta
data in the tilesets.  If I do this before I implement loading of the
maps it may save me some trouble later.
