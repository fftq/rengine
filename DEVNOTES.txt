This file contains a variety of development notes.

We should consider disabling some "unsafe" Lua built in functions such
as dofile(), load() and loadfile(), etc.

It appears that "Sandbox" is the term you're looking for.
See http://lua-users.org/wiki/SandBoxes. Also read the discussion
of the topic at http://stackoverflow.com/q/966162/115589 and

It seems that the accepted solution is to not call luaL_openlibs()
and rather copying and modifying linit.c

I really ought to be using SDL v2.0. It offers a variety of benefits
(I'm particularly interested in the Android and to a lesser extent iOS
portability), and the sooner I'm done with the conversion the better.

--I've been trying to compile v2.0, but it seems I need the DirectX SDK
for MinGW-- Scratch that. I now have SDL v2.0.0 compiled, and it seems
I'm gonna spend my weekend converting my SDL 1.2 code

My Bitmap module should have a #pragma pack() at the
structure declaration. The PAK file module should have
it too. See the bottom of this section on the wikipedia:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure_alignment#Typical_alignment_of_C_structs_on_x86
(Seems it is not a big GCC issue, rather a MSVC thing)

Speaking of the PAK file module, the ZIP file format turns out to be
not that different, so I should look into it more closely.
