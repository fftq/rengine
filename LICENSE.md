## FLTK

								 FLTK License
							   December 11, 2001

	The FLTK library and included programs are provided under the terms
	of the GNU Library General Public License (LGPL) with the following
	exceptions:

		1. Modifications to the FLTK configure script, config
		   header file, and makefiles by themselves to support
		   a specific platform do not constitute a modified or
		   derivative work.

		  The authors do request that such modifications be
		  contributed to the FLTK project - send all contributions
		  through the "Software Trouble Report" on the following page:
	 
			   http://www.fltk.org/str.php

		2. Widgets that are subclassed from FLTK widgets do not
		   constitute a derivative work.

		3. Static linking of applications and widgets to the
		   FLTK library does not constitute a derivative work
		   and does not require the author to provide source
		   code for the application or widget, use the shared
		   FLTK libraries, or link their applications or
		   widgets against a user-supplied version of FLTK.

		   If you link the application or widget to a modified
		   version of FLTK, then the changes to FLTK must be
		   provided under the terms of the LGPL in sections
		   1, 2, and 4.

		4. You do not have to provide a copy of the FLTK license
		   with programs that are linked to the FLTK library, nor
		   do you have to identify the FLTK license in your
		   program or documentation as required by section 6
		   of the LGPL.

		   However, programs must still identify their use of FLTK.
		   The following example statement can be included in user
		   documentation to satisfy this requirement:

			   [program/widget] is based in part on the work of
			   the FLTK project (http://www.fltk.org).
			   
The FLTK COPYING file then copies the text of the LGPL, which I'm not
going to repeat here as per clause 4 of the above.
